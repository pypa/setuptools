**[EXPERIMENTAL]** Added automatic discovery for ``py_modules`` and ``packages``
-- by :user:`abravalheri`.

Setuptools will try to find these values assuming that the package uses either
the *src-layout* (a ``src`` directory containing all the packages or modules),
the *flat-layout* (package directories directly under the project root),
or the *single-module* approach (isolated Python files, directly under
the project root).

The automatic discovery will also respect layouts that are explicitly
configured using the ``package_dir`` option.

For backward-compatibility, this behavior will be observed **only if both**
``py_modules`` **and** ``packages`` **are not set**.

If setuptools detects modules or packages that are not supposed to be in the
distribution, please manually set ``py_modules`` and ``packages`` in your
``setup.cfg`` or ``setup.py`` file.
If you are using a *flat-layout*, you can also consider switching to
*src-layout*.
