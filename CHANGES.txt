CHANGES
=======

------
0.6.11
------

* Found another case of SandboxViolation - fixed


------
0.6.10
------

* Reverted change made for the DistributionNotFound exception because
  zc.buildout uses the exception message to get the name of the
  distribution.

-----
0.6.9
-----

* Issue 90: unknown setuptools version can be added in the working set
* Issue 87: setupt.py doesn't try to convert distribute_setup.py anymore
  Initial Patch by arfrever.
* Issue 89: added a side bar with a download link to the doc.
* Issue 86: fixed missing sentence in pkg_resources doc.
* Added a nicer error message when a DistributionNotFound is raised.
* Issue 80: test_develop now works with Python 3.1
* Issue 93: upload_docs now works if there is an empty sub-directory.
* Issue 70: exec bit on non-exec files
* Issue 99: now the standalone easy_install command doesn't uses a
  "setup.cfg" if any exists in the working directory. It will use it
  only if triggered by ``install_requires`` from a setup.py call
  (install, develop, etc).
* Issue 101: Allowing ``os.devnull`` in Sandbox
* Issue 92: Fixed the "no eggs" found error with MacPort
  (platform.mac_ver() fails)
* Issue 103: test_get_script_header_jython_workaround not run
  anymore under py3 with C or POSIX local. Contributed by Arfrever.
* Issue 104: remvoved the assertion when the installation fails,
  with a nicer message for the end user.
* Issue 100: making sure there's no SandboxViolation when
  the setup script patches setuptools.

-----
0.6.8
-----

* Added "check_packages" in dist. (added in Setuptools 0.6c11)
* Fixed the DONT_PATCH_SETUPTOOLS state.

-----
0.6.7
-----

* Issue 58: Added --user support to the develop command
* Issue 11: Generated scripts now wrap their call to the script entry point
  in the standard "if name == 'main'"
* Added the 'DONT_PATCH_SETUPTOOLS' environment variable, so virtualenv
  can drive an installation that doesn't patch a global setuptools.
* Reviewed unladen-swallow specific change from
  http://code.google.com/p/unladen-swallow/source/detail?spec=svn875&r=719
  and determined that it no longer applies. Distribute should work fine with
  Unladen Swallow 2009Q3.
* Issue 21: Allow PackageIndex.open_url to gracefully handle all cases of a
  httplib.HTTPException instead of just InvalidURL and BadStatusLine.
* Removed virtual-python.py from this distribution and updated documentation
  to point to the actively maintained virtualenv instead.
* Issue 64: use_setuptools no longer rebuilds the distribute egg every
  time it is run
* use_setuptools now properly respects the requested version
* use_setuptools will no longer try to import a distribute egg for the
  wrong Python version
* Issue 74: no_fake should be True by default.
* Issue 72: avoid a bootstrapping issue with easy_install -U

-----
0.6.6
-----

* Unified the bootstrap file so it works on both py2.x and py3k without 2to3
  (patch by Holger Krekel)

0.6.5
-----

* Issue 65: cli.exe and gui.exe are now generated at build time,
  depending on the platform in use.

* Issue 67: Fixed doc typo (PEP 381/382)

* Distribute no longer shadows setuptools if we require a 0.7-series
  setuptools.  And an error is raised when installing a 0.7 setuptools with
  distribute.

* When run from within buildout, no attempt is made to modify an existing
  setuptools egg, whether in a shared egg directory or a system setuptools.

* Fixed a hole in sandboxing allowing builtin file to write outside of
  the sandbox.
