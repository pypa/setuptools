Setuptools stopped using ``egg_info --tag-build --tag-date`` for its own build
process. Instead version is now inferred from git tag history.
To ensure the proper version is considered, please make sure to fetch the git tags.
Local development tags are added to the latest version if the latest commit is not tagged.
