Incorporated ``wheel.macosx_libfile`` as a private module in the ``setuptools`` project.
The discussion leading to this approach can be found in #4935 and in the Discourse thread 87509.
The original code was provided to pypa/wheel#314 by Grzegorz Bokota (:user:`Czaki`),
and further improved by community members in the context of the :pypa:`wheel` project
(see commit history in https://github.com/pypa/wheel/commits/0.46.1/src/wheel/macosx_libfile.py).
Third party software interested in using this module are encouraged to interact
in the Discourse thread and propose alternatives (e.g. extracting this module
in its own separated project).
