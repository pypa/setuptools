``pkg_resources`` has been removed from Setuptools. Most common uses of ``pkg_resources`` have been superseded by the `importlib.resources <https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.resources.html>`_ and `importlib.metadata <https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.metadata.html>`_ projects. Projects and environments relying on ``pkg_resources`` for namespace packages or other behavior should depend on older versions of ``setuptools``.
