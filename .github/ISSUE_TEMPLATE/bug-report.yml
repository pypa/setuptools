      **Thank you for wanting to report a bug in setuptools!**


      ⚠
      Verify first that your issue is not
      [already reported on GitHub][issue search] and keep in mind and
      keep in mind that we may have to keep the current behavior because
      [every change breaks someone's workflow][XKCD 1172].
      We try to be mindful about this.

      Also test if the latest release and main branch are affected too.


      If you are seeking community support, please consider

      Typically, this involves modifying `requires` in `[build-system]` of
      [`pyproject.toml`](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/quickstart.html#basic-use),
      not just updating `setuptools` using `pip`.
