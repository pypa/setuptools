      ⚠
      Verify first that your issue is not
      [already reported on GitHub][issue search] and keep in mind and
      keep in mind that we may have to keep the current behavior because
      [every change breaks someone's workflow][XKCD 1172].
      We try to be mindful about this.

      Also test if the latest release and main branch are affected too.
