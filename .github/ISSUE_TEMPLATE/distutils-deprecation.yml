      So you've encountered an issue with the deprecation of distutils.

      First, sorry for the inconvenience while we work to untangle the
      legacy which is setuptools/distutils. Our goal is to ensure that
      the vast majority of use cases are satisfied prior to removing
      the legacy support.

      Please check the
      [existing reports](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues?q=label%3A%22distutils+deprecation%22+)
      to see if the affecting condition has been reported previously.

      **Environment**
- type: input
  attributes:
    label: setuptools version
    placeholder: For example, setuptools==69.1.0
    description: >-
      Please also test with the **latest version** of `setuptools`.

      Typically, this involves modifying `requires` in `[build-system]` of
      [`pyproject.toml`](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/quickstart.html#basic-use),
      not just updating `setuptools` using `pip`.
  validations:
    required: true
- type: input
  attributes:
    label: Python version
    placeholder: For example, Python 3.10
    description: >-
      Please ensure you are using a [supported version of Python](https://devguide.python.org/versions/#supported-versions).

      Setuptools does not support versions that have reached [`end-of-life`](https://devguide.python.org/versions/#unsupported-versions).

      Support for versions of Python under development (i.e. without a stable release) is experimental.
