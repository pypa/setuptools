.. _Creating ``distutils`` Extensions:

Extending or Customizing Setuptools
===================================

Setuptools design is based on the distutils_ package originally distributed
as part of Python's standard library, effectively serving as its successor
(as established in :pep:`632`).

This means that ``setuptools`` strives to honor the extension mechanisms
provided by ``distutils``, and allows developers to create third party packages
that modify or augment the build process behavior.

A simple way of doing that is to hook in new or existing
commands and ``setup()`` arguments just by defining "entry points".  These
are mappings from command or argument names to a specification of where to
import a handler from.  (See the section on :ref:`Dynamic Discovery of
Services and Plugins` for some more background on entry points).

The following sections describe the most common procedures for extending
the ``distutils`` functionality used by ``setuptools``.

.. important::
   Any entry-point defined in your ``setup.cfg``, ``setup.py`` or
   ``pyproject.toml`` files are not immediately available for use.  Your
   package needs to be installed first, then ``setuptools`` will be able to
   access these entry points.  For example consider a ``Project-A`` that
   defines entry points. When building ``Project-A``, these will not be
   available.  If ``Project-B`` declares a :doc:`build system requirement
   </userguide/dependency_management>` on ``Project-A``, then ``setuptools``
   will be able to use ``Project-A``' customizations.

Customizing Commands
--------------------

Both ``setuptools`` and ``distutils`` are structured around the *command design
pattern*. This means that each main action executed when building a
distribution package (such as creating a :term:`sdist <Source Distribution (or "sdist")>`
or :term:`wheel`) correspond to the implementation of a Python class.

Originally in ``distutils``, these commands would correspond to actual CLI
arguments that could be passed to the ``setup.py`` script to trigger a
different aspect of the build. In ``setuptools``, however, these command
objects are just a design abstraction that encapsulate logic and help to
organise the code.

You can overwrite existing commands (or add new ones) by defining entry
points in the ``distutils.commands`` group.  For example, if you wanted to add
a ``foo`` command, you might add something like this to your project:

.. code-block:: ini

    # setup.cfg
    ...
    [options.entry_points]
    distutils.commands =
         foo = mypackage.some_module:foo

Assuming, of course, that the ``foo`` class in ``mypackage.some_module`` is
a ``setuptools.Command`` subclass (documented below).

Once a project containing such entry points has been activated on ``sys.path``,
(e.g. by running ``pip install``) the command(s) will be available to any
``setuptools``-based project. In fact, this is
how setuptools' own commands are installed: the setuptools project's setup
script defines entry points for them!

The commands ``sdist``, ``build_py`` and ``build_ext`` are especially useful
to customize ``setuptools`` builds. Note however that when overwriting existing
commands, you should be very careful to maintain API compatibility.
Custom commands should try to replicate the same overall behavior as the
original classes, and when possible, even inherit from them.

You should also consider handling exceptions such as ``CompileError``,
``LinkError``, ``LibError``, among others. These exceptions are available in
the ``setuptools.errors`` module.

.. autoclass:: setuptools.Command
   :members:


Supporting sdists and editable installs in ``build`` sub-commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``build`` sub-commands (like ``build_py`` and ``build_ext``)
are encouraged to implement the following protocol:

.. autoclass:: setuptools.command.build.SubCommand
   :members:


Adding Arguments
----------------

.. warning:: Adding arguments to setup is discouraged as such arguments
   are only supported through imperative execution and not supported through
   declarative config.

Sometimes, your commands may need additional arguments to the ``setup()``
call.  You can enable this by defining entry points in the
``distutils.setup_keywords`` group.  For example, if you wanted a ``setup()``
argument called ``bar_baz``, you might add something like this to your
extension project:

.. code-block:: ini

    # setup.cfg
    ...
    [options.entry_points]
    distutils.commands =
         foo = mypackage.some_module:foo
    distutils.setup_keywords =
        bar_baz = mypackage.some_module:validate_bar_baz

The idea here is that the entry point defines a function that will be called
to validate the ``setup()`` argument, if it's supplied.  The ``Distribution``
object will have the initial value of the attribute set to ``None``, and the
validation function will only be called if the ``setup()`` call sets it to
a non-``None`` value.  Here's an example validation function::

    def assert_bool(dist, attr, value):
        """Verify that value is True, False, 0, or 1"""
        if bool(value) != value:
            raise SetupError(
                f"{attr!r} must be a boolean value (got {value!r}"
            )

Your function should accept three arguments: the ``Distribution`` object,
the attribute name, and the attribute value.  It should raise a
``SetupError`` (from the ``setuptools.errors`` module) if the argument
is invalid.  Remember, your function will only be called with non-``None`` values,
and the default value of arguments defined this way is always ``None``.  So, your
commands should always be prepared for the possibility that the attribute will
be ``None`` when they access it later.

If more than one active distribution defines an entry point for the same
``setup()`` argument, *all* of them will be called.  This allows multiple
extensions to define a common argument, as long as they agree on
what values of that argument are valid.


Customizing Distribution Options
--------------------------------

Plugins may wish to extend or alter the options on a ``Distribution`` object to
suit the purposes of that project. For example, a tool that infers the
``Distribution.version`` from SCM-metadata may need to hook into the
option finalization. To enable this feature, Setuptools offers an entry
point ``setuptools.finalize_distribution_options``. That entry point must
be a callable taking one argument (the ``Distribution`` instance).

If the callable has an ``.order`` property, that value will be used to
determine the order in which the hook is called. Lower numbers are called
first and the default is zero (0).

Plugins may read, alter, and set properties on the distribution, but each
plugin is encouraged to load the configuration/settings for their behavior
independently.


Defining Additional Metadata
----------------------------

Some extensible applications and frameworks may need to define their own kinds
of metadata, which they can then access using the :mod:`importlib.metadata` APIs.
Ordinarily, this is done by having plugin
developers include additional files in their ``ProjectName.egg-info``
directory.  However, since it can be tedious to create such files by hand, you
may want to create an extension that will create the necessary files
from arguments to ``setup()``, in much the same way that ``setuptools`` does
for many of the ``setup()`` arguments it adds.  See the section below for more
details.


.. _Adding new EGG-INFO Files:

Adding new EGG-INFO Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some extensible applications or frameworks may want to allow third parties to
develop plugins with application or framework-specific metadata included in
the plugins' EGG-INFO directory, for easy access via the ``pkg_resources``
metadata API.  The easiest way to allow this is to create an extension
to be used from the plugin projects' setup scripts (via ``setup_requires``)
that defines a new setup keyword, and then uses that data to write an EGG-INFO
file when the ``egg_info`` command is run.

The ``egg_info`` command looks for extension points in an ``egg_info.writers``
group, and calls them to write the files.  Here's a simple example of an
extension defining a setup argument ``foo_bar``, which is a list of
lines that will be written to ``foo_bar.txt`` in the EGG-INFO directory of any
project that uses the argument:

.. code-block:: ini

    # setup.cfg
    ...
    [options.entry_points]
    distutils.setup_keywords =
        foo_bar = setuptools.dist:assert_string_list
    egg_info.writers =
        foo_bar.txt = setuptools.command.egg_info:write_arg

This simple example makes use of two utility functions defined by setuptools
for its own use: a routine to validate that a setup keyword is a sequence of
strings, and another one that looks up a setup argument and writes it to
a file.  Here's what the writer utility looks like::

    def write_arg(cmd, basename, filename):
        argname = os.path.splitext(basename)[0]
        value = getattr(cmd.distribution, argname, None)
        if value is not None:
            value = "\n".join(value) + "\n"
        cmd.write_or_delete_file(argname, filename, value)

As you can see, ``egg_info.writers`` entry points must be a function taking
three arguments: a ``egg_info`` command instance, the basename of the file to
write (e.g. ``foo_bar.txt``), and the actual full filename that should be
written to.

In general, writer functions should honor the command object's ``dry_run``
setting when writing files, and use ``logging`` to do any console output.
The easiest way to conform to this requirement is to use
the ``cmd`` object's ``write_file()``, ``delete_file()``, and
``write_or_delete_file()`` methods exclusively for your file operations.
See those methods' docstrings for more details.


.. _Adding Support for Revision Control Systems:

Adding Support for Revision Control Systems
-------------------------------------------------

If the files you want to include in the source distribution are tracked using
Git, Mercurial or SVN, you can use the following packages to achieve that:

- Git and Mercurial: :pypi:`setuptools_scm`
- SVN: :pypi:`setuptools_svn`

If you would like to create a plugin for ``setuptools`` to find files tracked
by another revision control system, you can do so by adding an entry point to
the ``setuptools.file_finders`` group.  The entry point should be a function
accepting a single directory name, and should yield all the filenames within
that directory (and any subdirectories thereof) that are under revision
control.

For example, if you were going to create a plugin for a revision control system
called "foobar", you would write a function something like this:

.. code-block:: python

    def find_files_for_foobar(dirname):
        ...  # loop to yield paths that start with `dirname`

And you would register it in a setup script using something like this:

.. code-block:: ini

    # setup.cfg
    ...

    [options.entry_points]
    setuptools.file_finders =
        foobar = my_foobar_module:find_files_for_foobar

Then, anyone who wants to use your plugin can simply install it, and their
local setuptools installation will be able to find the necessary files.

It is not necessary to distribute source control plugins with projects that
simply use the other source control system, or to specify the plugins in
``setup_requires``.  When you create a source distribution with the ``sdist``
command, setuptools automatically records what files were found in the
``SOURCES.txt`` file.  That way, recipients of source distributions don't need
to have revision control at all.  However, if someone is working on a package
by checking out with that system, they will need the same plugin(s) that the
original author is using.

A few important points for writing revision control file finders:

* Your finder function MUST return relative paths, created by appending to the
  passed-in directory name.  Absolute paths are NOT allowed, nor are relative
  paths that reference a parent directory of the passed-in directory.

* Your finder function MUST accept an empty string as the directory name,
  meaning the current directory.  You MUST NOT convert this to a dot; just
  yield relative paths.  So, yielding a subdirectory named ``some/dir`` under
  the current directory should NOT be rendered as ``./some/dir`` or
  ``/somewhere/some/dir``, but *always* as simply ``some/dir``

* Your finder function SHOULD NOT raise any errors, and SHOULD deal gracefully
  with the absence of needed programs (i.e., ones belonging to the revision
  control system itself.  It *may*, however, use ``logging.warning()`` to
  inform the user of the missing program(s).

Final Remarks
-------------

* To use a ``setuptools`` plugin, your users will need to add your package as a
  build requirement to their build-system configuration. Please check out our
  guides on :doc:`/userguide/dependency_management` for more information.

* Directly calling ``python setup.py ...`` is considered a **deprecated** practice.
  You should not add new commands to ``setuptools`` expecting them to be run
  via this interface.
