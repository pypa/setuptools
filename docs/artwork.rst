   Setuptools logo, designed in 2021 by `Anderson Bravalheri`_

Elements of Design
==================

The main colours of the design are a dark pastel azure (``#336790``) and a pale
orange (``#E5B62F``), referred in this document simply as "blue" and "yellow"
respectively. The text uses the *Monoid* typeface, an open source webfont that
was developed by Andreas Larsen and contributors in 2015 and is distributed
under the MIT or SIL licenses (more information at
https://github.com/larsenwork/monoid)


Usage
=====

The preferred way of using the setuptools logo is over a white (or light)
background. Alternatively, the following options can be considered, depending
on the circumstances:

- *"negative"* design - for dark backgrounds (e.g. website displayed in "dark
  mode"): the white colour (``#FFFFFF``) of the background and the "blue"
  (``#336790``) colour of the design can be swapped.
- *"monochrome"* - when colours are not available (e.g. black and white printed
  media): a completely black or white version of the logo can also be used.
- *"banner"* mode: the symbol and text can be used alongside depending on the
  available space.

The following image illustrate these alternatives:

Please refer to the SVG files in the `setuptools repository`_ for the specific
shapes and proportions between the elements of the design.


Working with the Design
=======================

The `setuptools repository`_ contains a series of vector representations of the
design under the ``docs/images`` directory. These representations can be
manipulated via any graphic editor that support SVG files,
however the free and open-source software Inkscape_ is recommended for maximum
compatibility.

When selecting the right file to work with, file names including
``editable-inkscape`` indicate "more editable" elements (e.g. editable text),
while the others prioritise SVG paths for maximum reproducibility.

Also notice that you might have to `install the correct fonts`_ to be able to
visualise or edit some of the designs.


Inspiration
===========

This design was inspired by :user:`cajhne`'s `original proposal`_ and the
ancient symbol of the ouroboros_.
It features a snake moving in a circular trajectory not only as a reference to
the Python programming language but also to the :pep:`wheel package format <427>` as one
of the distribution formats supported by setuptools.
The shape of the snake also resembles a cog, which together with the hammer is
a nod to the two words that compose the name of the project.
