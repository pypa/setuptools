Please read `How to write the perfect pull request
<http://blog.jaraco.com/2014/04/how-to-write-perfect-pull-request.html>`_
for some tips on contributing to open source projects. Although the article
is not authoritative, it was authored by the maintainer of Setuptools, so
reflects his opinions and will improve the likelihood of acceptance and
quality of contribution.

------------------
Project Management
------------------

Setuptools is maintained primarily in Bitbucket at `this home
<https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools>`_. Setuptools is maintained under the
Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) with several core contributors. All bugs
for Setuptools are filed and the canonical source is maintained in Bitbucket.

User support and discussions are done through the issue tracker (for specific)
issues, through the distutils-sig mailing list, or on IRC (Freenode) at
#pypa.

Discussions about development happen on the pypa-dev mailing list or on IRC
(Freenode) at #pypa-dev.

-----------------
Authoring Tickets
-----------------

Before authoring any source code, it's often prudent to file a ticket
describing the motivation behind making changes. First search to see if a
ticket already exists for your issue. If not, create one. Try to think from
the perspective of the reader. Explain what behavior you expected, what you
got instead, and what factors might have contributed to the unexpected
behavior. In Bitbucket, surround a block of code or traceback with the triple
backtick "\`\`\`" so that it is formatted nicely.

Filing a ticket provides a forum for justification, discussion, and
clarification. The ticket provides a record of the purpose for the change and
any hard decisions that were made. It provides a single place for others to
reference when trying to understand why the software operates the way it does
or why certain changes were made.

Setuptools makes extensive use of hyperlinks to tickets in the changelog so
that system integrators and other users can get a quick summary, but then
jump to the in-depth discussion about any subject referenced.

-----------
Source Code
-----------

Grab the code at Bitbucket::

    $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools

If you want to contribute changes, we recommend you fork the repository on
Bitbucket, commit the changes to your repository, and then make a pull request
on Bitbucket. If you make some changes, don't forget to:

- add a note in CHANGES.txt

Please commit all changes in the 'default' branch against the latest available
commit or for bug-fixes, against an earlier commit or release in which the
bug occurred.

If you find yourself working on more than one issue at a time, Setuptools
generally prefers Git-style branches, so use Mercurial bookmarks or Git
branches or multiple forks to maintain separate efforts.

Setuptools also maintains an unofficial `Git mirror in Github
<https://github.com/jaraco/setuptools>`_. Contributors are welcome to submit
pull requests here, but because they are not integrated with the Bitbucket
Issue tracker, linking pull requests to tickets is more difficult. The
Continuous Integration tests that validate every release are run from this
mirror.

-------
Testing
-------

The primary tests are run using py.test. To run the tests::

    $ python setup.py test

Or install py.test into your environment and run ``PYTHONPATH=. py.test``
or ``python -m pytest``.

Under continuous integration, additional tests may be run. See the
``.travis.yml`` file for full details on the tests run under Travis-CI.

-------------------
Semantic Versioning
-------------------

Setuptools follows ``semver`` with some exceptions:

- Uses two-segment version when three segment version ends in zero
- Omits 'v' prefix for tags.

.. explain value of reflecting meaning in versions.

----------------------
Building Documentation
----------------------

Setuptools relies on the Sphinx system for building documentation and in
particular the ``build_sphinx`` distutils command. To build the
documentation, invoke::

    python setup.py build_sphinx

from the root of the repository. Setuptools will download a compatible
build of Sphinx and any requisite plugins and then build the
documentation in the build/sphinx directory.

Setuptools does not support invoking the doc builder from the docs/
directory as some tools expect.
