Please read `How to write the perfect pull request
<http://blog.jaraco.com/2014/04/how-to-write-perfect-pull-request.html>`_
for some tips on contributing to open source projects. Although the article
is not authoritative, it was authored by the maintainer of Setuptools, so
reflects his opinions and will improve the likelihood of acceptance and
quality of contribution.

------------------
Project Management
------------------

Setuptools is maintained primarily in Bitbucket at `this home
<https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools>`_. Setuptools is maintained under the
Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) with several core contributors. All bugs
for Setuptools are filed and the canonical source is maintained in Bitbucket.

User support and discussions are done through the issue tracker (for specific)
issues, through the distutils-sig mailing list, or on IRC (Freenode) at
#pypa.

Discussions about development happen on the pypa-dev mailing list or on IRC
(Freenode) at #pypa-dev.


-----------
Source Code
-----------

Grab the code at Bitbucket::

    $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools

If you want to contribute changes, we recommend you fork the repository on
Bitbucket, commit the changes to your repository, and then make a pull request
on Bitbucket. If you make some changes, don't forget to:

- add a note in CHANGES.txt

Please commit all changes in the 'default' branch against the latest available
commit or for bug-fixes, against an earlier commit or release in which the
bug occurred.

If you find yourself working on more than one issue at a time, Setuptools
generally prefers Git-style branches, so use Mercurial bookmarks or Git
branches or multiple forks to maintain separate efforts.

Setuptools also maintains an unofficial `Git mirror in Github
<https://github.com/jaraco/setuptools>`_. Contributors are welcome to submit
pull requests here, but because they are not integrated with the Bitbucket
Issue tracker, linking pull requests to tickets is more difficult. The
Continuous Integration tests that validate every release are run from this
mirror.

-------
Testing
-------

The primary tests are run using py.test. To run the tests::

    $ python setup.py ptr

Or install py.test into your environment and run ``py.test``.

Under continuous integration, additional tests may be run. See the
``.travis.yml`` file for full details on the tests run under Travis-CI.

Semantic Versioning
-------------------

Setuptools follows ``semver`` with some exceptions:

- Uses two-segment version when three segment version ends in zero
- Omits 'v' prefix for tags.

.. explain value of reflecting meaning in versions.
