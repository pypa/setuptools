Documentation
=============

Setuptools is a fully-featured, actively-maintained, and stable library
designed to facilitate packaging Python projects.

It helps developers to easily share reusable code (in the form of a library)
and programs (e.g., CLI/GUI tools implemented in Python), that can be installed
with :pypi:`pip` and uploaded to `PyPI <https://pypi.org>`_.
